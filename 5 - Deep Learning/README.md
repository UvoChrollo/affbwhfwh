Steps modelling with TensorFlow
1. Get data ready (turn into tensors)
2. Creating a model - define the input and output layers, as well as the hidden layers of a deep learning model
3. Compiling a model - define the loss function (in other words, the function which tells our model how wrong it is) and the optimizer (tells our model how to improve the patterns its learning) and evaluation metrics (what we can use to interpret the performance of our model).
4. Fitting a model - letting the model to try find patterns between X and y, and make a prediction
5. Evaluate the model
6. Improve the model through experimentation
7. Save and load the trained model

what is ```tf.expand_dims``` ?<br>
expand_dims will not add or reduce elements in a tensor, it just changes the shape by adding 1 to dimensions. For example, a vector with 10 elements could be treated as a 10x1 matrix.

Improve Deep Learning Model
1. Adding Layers
2. Increase the number of hidden units
3. Change the activation functions
4. Change the optimization functions
5. Change the learning rate
6. Fitting on more data
7. Fitting for longer
